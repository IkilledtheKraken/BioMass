This mod was first made by Roboto. All rights and stuff go to him.
In Roboto's biomass, you need biomass,o2,co2, nutrients, microflora, food, water, waste, wastewater and and all the parts to support them.
I wanted something simple and to be able to max time warp without having the system "die".
I have changed it so you only need 4 parts(not counting power etc.)to have a working sudo life support/fuel generator system.


CHANGES:
Resorce values/outputs have been changed.
Part mass has been reduced.

The station Hub is now a command pod that has biomass, o2, and co2 and 4 Kerbals.
The hub consumes electricity, o2 and biomass while produceing co2.

The greenhouse uses electricity and co2 to produce biomass and o2.

The compressor uses electricity and biomass to produce MonoPropellant and co2.

The bioreactor uses electricity,biomass and o2 to produce liquidfuel and oxidizer.

Notes:
If you use all of the biomass, o2 and co2 the system will die and will not be able to be restarted.

When you go above 1000 warp the system will use up all the biomass, o2 and co2.
To use the time warp at max speed, turn off the fuel crossfeed for the co2 in the station hub.
Your Kerbals and a small portion of biomass will go into cryostasis (not realy) and you can revive the biomass with 
the co2 to start making o2 and "restart" the system. If you dont save the co2 biomass will not grow and you will not be able to make 
fuel, monoprop or o2.

I have changed the mass and outputs so you can build a ship that uses the 4 parts,2 skippers on 2 orange tanks to put a total 
ship mass of 90t barely into LKO. You have to start making fuel at the launch pad to have enough to get up there.
